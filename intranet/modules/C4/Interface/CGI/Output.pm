=head1 NAME

C4::CGI::Output - Convenience functions for handling outputting HTML pages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::CGI::Output;

  print $query->header(-type => C4::CGI::Output::gettype($output)), $output;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions in this module peek into a piece of HTML and return strings
related to the (guessed) charset.

	     );

=item guesscharset

   &guesscharset($output)

"Guesses" the charset from the some HTML that would be output.

C<$output> is the HTML page to be output. If it contains a META tag
with a Content-Type, the tag will be scanned for a language code.
This code is returned if it is found; undef is returned otherwise.

This function only does sloppy guessing; it will be confused by
unexpected things like SGML comments. What it basically does is to
grab something that looks like a META tag and scan it.

    my($html) = @_;
    my $charset = undef;
    local($`, $&, $', $1, $2, $3);
    # FIXME... These regular expressions will miss a lot of valid tags!
    if ($html =~ /<meta\s+http-equiv=(["']?)Content-Type\1\s+content=(["'])text\/html\s*;\s*charset=([^\2\s\r\n]+)\2\s*(?:\/?)>/is) {

    } elsif ($html =~ /<meta\s+content=(["'])text\/html\s*;\s*charset=([^\1\s\r\n]+)\1\s+http-equiv=(["']?)Content-Type\3\s*(?:\/?)>/is) {
        $charset = $2;
    }
    return $charset;
} # guess

sub guesstype ($) {
    my($html) = @_;
    my $charset = guesscharset($html);
    return defined $charset? "text/html; charset=$charset": "text/html";
}

=item output_html_with_http_headers

   &output_html_with_http_headers($query, $cookie, $html)

Outputs the HTML page $html with the appropriate HTTP headers,
with the authentication cookie $cookie and a Content-Type that
corresponds to the HTML page $html.

sub output_html_with_http_headers {
    my($query, $cookie, $html) = @_;

	-cookie => $cookie,
    ), $html;
