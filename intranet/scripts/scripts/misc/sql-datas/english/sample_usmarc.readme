The included sample_usmarc.mrc can be used to demonstrate
import of a set of MARC21 (iso2709) records. The set includes
about 3K records. Note that if you want holdings to work
correctly you'll have to tweak the records to match your
local configuration. To import the records use the 
bulkmarcimport tool in misc/migration_tools/

If you have questions feel free to ask them on the list
or email me directly.
