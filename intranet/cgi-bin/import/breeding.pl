# Removing config info from z3950*sh and using C4::Context in processz3950queue (Fixed bug 39)
#
# Revision 1.1  2003/06/04 13:46:25  tipaul
# moving breeding farm import to parameters page (GUI) and to new import/ directory (code structure)
#
# Revision 1.33  2003/04/29 16:48:36  tipaul
# really proud of this commit :-)
# z3950 search and import seems to works fine.
# Let me explain how :
# * a "search z3950" button is added in the addbiblio template.
# * when clicked, a popup appears and z3950/search.pl is called
# * z3950/search.pl calls addz3950search in the DB
# * the z3950 daemon retrieve the records and stores them in z3950results AND in marc_breeding table.
# * as long as there as searches pending, the popup auto refresh every 2 seconds, and says how many searches are pending.
# * when the user clicks on a z3950 result => the parent popup is called with the requested biblio, and auto-filled
#
# Note :
# * character encoding support : (It's a nightmare...) In the z3950servers table, a "encoding" column has been added. You can put "UNIMARC" or "USMARC" in this column. Depending on this, the char_decode in C4::Biblio.pm replaces marc-char-encode by an iso 8859-1 encoding. Note that in the breeding import this value has been added too, for a better support.
# * the marc_breeding and z3950* tables have been modified : they have an encoding column and the random z3950 number is stored too for convenience => it's the key I use to list only requested biblios in the popup.
#
# Revision 1.32  2003/04/22 12:22:54  tipaul
# 1st draft for z3950 client import.
# moving Breeding farm script to a perl package C4/Breeding.pm
#
# Revision 1.31  2003/02/19 01:01:07  wolfpac444
# Removed the unecessary $dbh argument from being passed.
# Resolved a few minor FIXMEs.
#
# Revision 1.30  2003/02/02 07:18:38  acli
# Moved C4/Charset.pm to C4/Interface/CGI/Output.pm
#
# Create output_html_with_http_headers function to contain the "print $query
# ->header(-type => guesstype...),..." call. This is in preparation for
# non-HTML output (e.g., text/xml) and charset conversion before output in
# the future.
#
# Created C4/Interface/CGI/Template.pm to hold convenience functions specific
# to the CGI interface using HTML::Template
#
# Modified moremembers.pl to make the "sex" field localizable for languages
# where M and F doesn't make sense
#
# Revision 1.29  2003/01/28 15:28:31  tipaul
# removing use MARC::Charset
# Was a buggy test
#
# Revision 1.28  2003/01/28 15:00:31  tipaul
# user can now search in breeding farm with isbn/issn or title. Title/name are stored in breeding farm and showed when a search is done
#
# Revision 1.27  2003/01/26 23:21:49  acli
# Handle non-latin1 charsets
#
# Revision 1.26  2003/01/23 12:26:41  tipaul
# upgrading import in breeding farm (you can now search on ISBN or on title) AND character encoding.
#
# Revision 1.25  2003/01/21 08:13:50  tipaul
# character encoding ISO646 => 8859-1, first draft
#
# Revision 1.24  2003/01/14 16:41:17  tipaul
# bugfix : use gettemplate_and_user instead of gettemplate.
# fix a blank screen in 1.3.3 in "import in breeding farm"
#
# Revision 1.23  2003/01/06 13:06:28  tipaul
# removing trailing #
#
# Revision 1.22  2002/11/12 15:58:43  tipaul
# road to 1.3.2 :
# * many bugfixes
# * adding value_builder : you can map a subfield in the marc_subfield_structure to a sub stored in "value_builder" directory. In this directory you can create screen used to build values with any method. In this commit is a 1st draft of the builder for 100$a unimarc french subfield, which is composed of 35 digits, with 12 differents values (only the 4th first are provided for instance)
#
# Revision 1.21  2002/10/22 15:50:23  tipaul
# road to 1.3.2 : adding a biblio in MARC format.
# seems to work a few.
# still to do :
# * manage html checks (mandatory subfields...)
# * add list of acceptable values (authorities)
# * manage ## in MARC format
# * manage correctly repeatable fields
# and probably a LOT of bugfixes
#
# Revision 1.20  2002/10/16 12:46:19  arensb
# Added a FIXME comment.
#
# Revision 1.19  2002/10/15 10:14:44  tipaul
# road to 1.3.2. Full rewrite of marcimport.pl.
# The acquisition system in MARC version will work like this :
# * marcimport will put marc records into a "breeding farm" table.
# * when the user want to add a biblio, he enters first the ISBN/ISSN of the biblio. koha searches into breeding farm and if the record exists, it is shown to the user to help him adding the biblio. When the biblio is added, it's deleted from the breeding farm.
#
# This commit :
# * modify acqui.simple home page  (addbooks.pl)
# * adds import into breeding farm
#
# Please note that :
# * z3950 functionnality is dropped from "marcimport" will be added somewhere else.
# * templates are in a new acqui.simple sub directory, and the marcimport template directory will become obsolete soon.I think this is more logic
#
