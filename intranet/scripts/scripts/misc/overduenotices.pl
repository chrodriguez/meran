# Script Name: overduenotices.pl
# Script Version: 1.0
# Date:  2003/9/7
# Author:  Stephen Hedges (shedges@skemotah.com)
# modified by Paul Poulain (paul@koha-fr.org)
# Description: 
#	This script runs a Koha report of items that
#	are between 7 and 30 days overdue and generates
#       a file that may be dumped to a printer.  The time period
#	may be changed by editing the SQL statement handle
#	prepared in line 52.  The actual wording of the overdue
#	notices may be changed by editing the $notice variable
#	in line 101.  The current notice text is formatted to
#	fit the standard 34-line 'Speedimailer' form.
# Revision History:
#    1.0  2003/9/7: original version

This script will send overdue notices by e-mail and prepare a file of\nnotices for printing if the borrower does not have e-mail.
You MUST edit this script for your library BEFORE you run it for the first time!
See the comments in the script for directions on changing the script.
This script has 2 parameters :
	-c to confirm and remove this help & warning
	-n to avoid sending any mail. Instead, all mail messages are printed on screen. Usefull for testing purposes.

Do you wish to continue? (y/n)
